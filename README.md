SimpleGameEngine (WIP)
===========
Very Simple game engine designed by Markus Tonsaker.

I'm building this game engine to grasp a better understanding of how game engines work in Java.  Definitely not the most efficient game engine out there and I would highly not recommend using this engine for certain game development.

For multiplayer/networking, I use the Kryonet library at https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet
