SimpleGameEngine (WIP)
===========
Very Simple game engine designed by Markus Tonsaker.  I'm building this game engine to grasp a better understanding of how game engines work in Java.  Definately not the most efficient game engine I would highly not recommend to use this engine for many games.

For multiplayer/networking, I use the Kryonet library at https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet
